# Roulette Chance
A very simple app that allows you to calculate the chances of the next shell in the shotgun, meant to be used as aid in [Buckshot Roulette](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/)
I made this app because i just wanted to see which chances i could get out of curiosity and then decided to expand this into something more useful and i wanted  to practice making actually useful mobile apps
